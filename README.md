# cos
My OS made from scratch using only GRUB and OSDev.org.

## What in the hell is this??
If I'm gonna be honest I have small plans with this, but I'm just going for an OS to run my bytecode NBC. Most likely going to be shit, but oh well...

## How do I compile this piece of crap?
1. Make sure you have an i686-elf cross compiler ready to go and in your $PATH ([Find how to compile it here](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)).
  * If not, you can use the barebones toolchain included, or you can get that toolchain from [here](https://github.com/rm-hull/barebones-toolchain)
2. Run build.sh
3. Use the cos.iso to run in a VM or refer to [here](http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones#Booting_the_Kernel) for more options
