# NOTES

## About my formatting
 - I completely self-taught myself how to code, and as such will have some strange formatting, so please don't cringe too much while looking at it
 - I try to comment very thoroughly (my spelling sucks too, but as of writing this it's like 2:00AM so I have an excuse), even on parts that the code kinda explains itself, so I hope you don't hate seeing a lot of comments in code
 - Since this whole thing is a learning experience, the main thing I did learn is it's better to not reinvent the wheel and duct tape in some others' code from time to time. This does lead to inconsistent formatting. After a while, though, after it's bothered me enough, I will go back through it, fix the formatting, and comment on basically what every single bit does.

##About the OS
 - It's shit



That's about all
